                <p className='text-base font-courier mt-2'>It was early evening on March 18, 2021, when Bakkom began the time-consuming process of reviewing and digitizing photos he had taken over two decades prior. </p>

                <p className='text-base font-courier mt-2'>During the photos’ transition from film to digital, a glitch occurred -- the images were dismantled and haphazardly conjoined back together, almost unrecognizable from their original takes.

              <div className='mt-5'>
                <p className='text-base font-courier mt-2'>Just twenty years shy of when he had originally intended, Bakkom decided to publish his work.</p>

                <p className='text-base font-courier mt-2'>This is the story of Smart World Technology, presented by Archive 91. Photographed by Matthew Bakkom.<br />1 World Trade Center, New York, NY.<br />February 2001.</p>

              <div className='mt-5'>
                <p className='text-base font-courier mt-2'>In the fall of 2000, Bakkom, along with a handful of other up-and-coming NYC artists, were selected to join the “Lower Manhattan Worldviews Studio Program” which provided space and community for local creatives on the 91st floor of 1 World Trade Center.</p>
              </div>
              <div className='mt-5'>
                <p className='text-base font-courier mt-2'>Despite the fact that the provided studio space was unfinished and unfurnished, the artists were ecstatic. In the early 2000s, The World Trade Center was viewed as the capitalist powerhouse of the world, the views were astounding and the rent was free.</p>

              <div className='mt-5'>
                <p className='text-base font-courier mt-2'>Two Japanese holding companies went bankrupt and abandoned their offices during Bakkom’s first month working at the WTC.  The final office that shared the West Wing on the 91st floor belonged to a company named Smart World Technologies.  Their office also sat silent.<br />Until February 7, 2001.</p>

                <p className='text-base font-courier mt-2'>Early that morning,  Bakkom arrived on the 91st floor and noticed the door to their lone remaining neighbour ajar. He stepped in, only to be met by a middle-aged man in formal business attire with heavy bags shadowing his eyes.</p>

            <h2 className='text-black font-presto italic'>"The sight of the space, the remnants, and of what had once been a “promising provider of branded internet portals” during the peak of the dot-com Bubble, immediately struck me as something worthy of documentation; an exposé of the hidden failures obscured by the hype of the market, ridden with comic energy of mercantile hubris and in this case, all beneath the facade of one of Global Capitalism’s most revered icons" - M.

                <p className='text-base font-courier mt-2'>For a myriad of reasons -- out of respect for the victims, the buildings themselves and with regard to the ongoing legacy of destruction and the darkness that ensued globally, Bakkom’s exhibition never took place. Until now.</p>
